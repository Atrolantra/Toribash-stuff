# Item Sending
This script is designed to send one type of item (bought in bulk using TSA magic so that they have consecutive itemids) to many different users.

### Eg
#### Input (A list of users in send_to_list.txt - one per line)
user1  
user2  
user3  

There will also be an input prompt to enter the itemid of the first item of the batch.  
Eg if 3 items were bought and need to be sent with the itemids 15384, 15385, 15386 you would enter the first one.
