This is a script that takes a bunch of names as input and outputs matches in a big daisyring after filtering out banned guys (and in the future, filtering out inactive ones).

### Eg
#### Input (list of names, one per line in names.txt)
x  
y  
z  

#### Output (In giving.txt)
x gives to y  
y gives to z  
z gives to x
