# Toribash_stuff
This is where I'm going to keep all of my Toribash related python stuff.
At the moment most of the implementations are kept in /library/toripy.py and various implementations and scripts are located in the other folders around.

### Requirements
Python 2.7 is needed to run this. A requirements file will be added soon.

### To use
Clone or download a copy. Then just run the script you want. The directory where you put the Toribash-stuff folder must be in your system path though so that scripts that use it can successfully import from it. Otherwise just put the script and toripy file in the same directory and edit the script's import line.
