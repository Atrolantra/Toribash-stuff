# Toribash_stuff
This is where I'm going to keep all of my Toribash related python stuff.
At the moment most of the implementations are kept in /library/toripy.py and various implementations and scripts are located in the other folders around.

At the moment it's a mix of tools I'm currently using (some mod related and some not) and other Toribash stuff I'm working on like a replaymerger for an upcoming GM event.

### Requirements
Python 2.7 is needed to run this. The only other requirement at this time is the requests module and can be seen in requirements.txt.

### To use
Clone or download a copy. Then just run the script you want. Some are more complete than others and all core functions can be found in /library/toripy.py.
The directory where you put the Toribash_stuff folder must be in your python path (environment variable stuff) though so that scripts that use it can successfully import from it. Otherwise just put the script and toripy file in the same directory and edit the script's import line.
